- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @IamAmishaG
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything and everything about DATA! I have always been fascinated with Excel and visualizations since a kid, and now I am trying to figure
  out a way to make a career off of it. I'm passionate towards it and now spend most of my time learning more about it. DIving into statistics and learning more about it
  has piqued my interest in machine learning which I will have to deep dive into. The more the data, the merrier, said no one ever. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Python, Microsoft Excel,  SQL and Tableau for working with Data.
