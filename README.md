- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything and everything about DATA! I have always been fascinated with Excel and visuaizations since a kid, and now I just am trying to figure
- out a way to a career off of it. I'm passionate towards it and now spend most of my time learning more about it. DIving into statistics and learning more about it has
